    <h1>Strangers From Hell</h1>
    <p>Strangers From Hell is a South Korean television series that is streaming
      on Netflix. It's about a young man in his 20s who moves to Seoul after landing
      an internship in a company. While looking for a place to stay, he stumbles upon
      Eden Studio, an ominous cheap dormitory and decides to stay there as he is low on
      money. As time goes on, mysterious occurrences start occurring in the studio, causing
      the main character to start fearing the studio's residents. This series is easily one
      of my favorites as it sets the atmosphere very well and makes the audience feel like
      they're in the main character's situation.
