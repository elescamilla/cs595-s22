    <h1>Memento</h1>
    <p>Memento is a 2000 American mystery thriller film written and directed
      by Christopher Nolan. It's about a man who suffers from short-term memory
      loss and the inability to form new memories. He is searching for the people
      who attacked him and killed his wife, using an intricate system of Polaroid
      photographs and tattoos to track information he cannot remember. Since I am
      a big fan of the mystery/thriller/psychological genre, this movie easily became
      a favorite especially since it came from one of the best directors in my opinion
      Christopher Nolan.
