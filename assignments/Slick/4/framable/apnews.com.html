Denied an easy and early victory, Russia’s military is reverting to the scorched earth tactics of its past offensives in Syria and Chechnya, and pounding population centers with airstrikes and artillery barrages that leave civilians like those in the port city of Mariupol able to safely venture out for food or water, to bury the dead, or to flee.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After Biden rallied European allies to join in sweeping sanctions against Russia over the invasion at the outset, his tasks now include dealing with some NATO members that are pushing for more involvement directly in the fighting. That includes proposals by Poland for peacekeepers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Biden’s trip includes a summit Thursday of NATO leaders, who will use the meeting to look at strengthening the bloc’s own deterrence and defense, immediately and in the long term, to deal with the now openly confrontational Putin.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That gathering is intended not just to show NATO’s “support to Ukraine, but also our readiness to protect and defend all NATO allies,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“And by sending that message, we are preventing an escalation of the conflict to a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia,” Stoltenberg said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Front-line NATO members on the alliance’s eastern flank are also asking for advanced U.S. and British air defense systems to guard against the kind of missile and air assaults Russia is unleashing on Ukraine.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We have to strengthen our eastern flank of NATO.

Jane Campion’s last major shot at picture (and director) was with “The Piano,” but in 1994 that basically stood no chance against “Schindler’s List.” This time, it’s her film that has the leg up on the Spielberg. And yet there is a possibility that “CODA” could “Little Miss Sunshine”/”Green Book” its way in there as the feel-good alternative (which was what “Belfast” was supposed to be), which was made even stronger after it won \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/oscars-entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-movies-dfcdc511b1096170e0374c0df4e1e7af\">the top honor at the Producers Guild this weekend.\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='afs:Card:123935587246' class='hub-peek-embed'>Hub peek embed (AcademyAwards) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) \u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>COYLE: I'm \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-0070457a65779ef89baeeb4bd9208e44\">calling the “CODA” upset\u003c/a>. The smart money is on Campion's film. But the win for “CODA” at the Screen Actors Guild — where “The Power of the Dog” failed to get nominated for best ensemble — suggests strong passion for the film, and maybe a crowd-pleasing advantage on the academy's preferential ballot. Either film, though, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/oscar-nominations-academy-awards-6072fc4d4f4c03842a1d1df5d47984b4\">will symbolize the ascent of streaming in Hollywood\u003c/a>. It would hand a streaming service — Netflix or Apple — Hollywood's most prestigious honor for the first time. Maybe that's a big deal, maybe it's belated confirmation of what everyone has known for some time. \u003c/p>\u003cp>BEST ACTRESS\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Nominees: Jessica Chastain, “The Eyes of Tammy Faye”; Olivia Colman, “The Lost Daughter”; Penélope Cruz, “Parallel Mothers”; Nicole Kidman, “Being the Ricardos”; Kristen Stewart, “Spencer.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>COYLE: This has been the cruelest of categories, laying waste to most expectations and some very sensational performances. Lady Gaga, Caitríona Balfe, Jennifer Hudson and my favorite performance of the year — Renate Reinsve (“The Worst Person in the World”) — are just some of the masses among the snubbed. Yet, surprisingly, a very Oscar bait-y performance from a movie released early in the season — \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-religion-arts-and-entertainment-jessica-chastain-rupaul-41be4cfba653f863ee050c1e5e51dd55\">Jessica Chastain as the televangelist Tammy Faye\u003c/a> — has moved to favorite status after winning the SAG Awards. That may partly be because Chastain, a three-time nominee but never a winner, is one of Hollywood’s best actors and the time has come to honor her, for a film she steered into existence. I think she’ll win, but \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-movies-olivia-colman-elena-ferrante-a8284ef2b7ddb53452db6e91fa412904\">Olivia Colman — typically brilliant in “The Lost Daughter” \u003c/a> — could sneak in for her second Academy Award. \u003c/p>\u003cp>BAHR: Chastain should have already won several Oscars at this point, and not even necessarily for the ones she got nominations for (“The Help” and “Zero Dark Thirty”). However improbable for a movie that has some big issues, including the way it turns a blind eye to Tammy Faye’s complicities in the scam, the tide has shifted in her favor and she’ll probably get her win. Still, I still think there’s a small possibility that it will go to \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-kristen-stewart-new-york-arts-and-entertainment-b93b4f2b37d4f592600278cbc1739e12\">Kristen Stewart, who has been on a rollercoaster path \u003c/a> after starting the season at the top.\u003c/p>\u003cp>BEST ACTOR\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Nominees: Javier Bardem, “Being the Ricardos”; Benedict Cumberbatch, “The Power of the Dog”; Andrew Garfield, “tick, tick … Boom!”; \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-new-york-movies-film-festivals-f53768039ae97c3919c85dd131bc3727\">Denzel Washington, “The Tragedy of Macbeth”\u003c/a>; Will Smith, “King Richard. \u003c/p>\u003cp>BAHR: It’s always a bit of a snooze when categories are locked for months, but it would be a \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-sports-tennis-arts-and-entertainment-movies-3c5f83df3f1c7ce964da770709360bf3\">major surprise if Will Smith didn’t get his first Oscar win for “King Richard.”\u003c/a> After a period of giving some possibly TMI interviews, Smith stepped back from the spotlight, let the race play out and still emerged triumphant. Not only did he give a terrific performance in the film, but his \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yESxnS34b8\">SAG speech, in which he was funny, humble and gracious\u003c/a> to his co-star Aunjanue Ellis and subjects Venus and Serena Williams, was also a helpful reminder of the power of his star charisma. This is such a safe, respectable batch, though. It may have been fun to add some Simon Rex (for “Red Rocket”) chaos to the mix.\u003c/p>\u003cp>COYLE: Smith will over-share his way to the Oscar, a deserved win for one of the movies' most insanely charming stars. Smith might have already won best actor (for “Ali”) if not for Denzel's titanic performance that year in “Training Day.” This time, it's Smith's turn. If I could add someone here, it'd be Adam Driver in “Annette.\" If he can't have best actor, then he should surely take the award for most devastating and fiercely committed singing performance opposite a puppet baby. Wait, I'm being told that isn't an Oscar category.\u003c/p>\u003cp>BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Nominees: Jessie Buckley, “The Lost Daughter”; Ariana DeBose, “West Side Story”; Judi Dench, “Belfast”; Kirsten Dunst, “The Power of the Dog”; Aunjanue Ellis, “King Richard.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>COYLE: Thanks to her \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/oscars-entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-race-and-ethnicity-steven-spielberg-5e9b663d823501696ecdb19b801a7bd7\">show-stopping, breakthrough performance in “West Side Story” DeBose has had this category locked down all season\u003c/a>, and it’s hard not to be moved by the historical symmetry. Sixty years ago, Rita Moreno won for the same role, Anita, in 1961’s “West Side Story,\" making her the first Latina to win an Oscar. We’ll have to see if DeBose is as brief as Moreno was accepting her award. (Her total speech: “I can’t believe it! Good Lord! I leave you with that.”) Still, it was a crime to neglect Kathryn Hunter's multiplying witches in “Macbeth.\" What's foul isn't always fair. \u003c/p>\u003cp>BAHR: I was prepared for Kirsten Dunst to finally get her moment up on that podium but \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-sofia-coppola-academy-awards-jane-campion-0fb9007104b786446b74c4500d71f82b\">Kiki’s shrimp will have to wait\u003c/a>. At least she broke the seal and got a nomination. And DeBose should definitely be ready with a killer speech. Do you think she’ll take Moreno as her date? Maybe she’ll don the black and gold dress Moreno wore in 1962 and famously repeated in 2018. \u003c/p>\u003cp>BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Nominees: \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-judi-dench-jamie-dornan-kenneth-branagh-belfast-1c2961b848ba94c3fbe16e585569c895\"> Ciarán Hinds, “Belfast”\u003c/a>; Troy Kotsur, “CODA”; Jesse Plemons, “The Power of the Dog”; J.K. Simmons, “Being the Ricardos”; Kodi Smit-McPhee, “The Power of the Dog.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>BAHR: Among mostly first-time nominees (save for J.K. Simmons, who previously won for “Whiplash”), “CODA’s” \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/academy-awards-entertainment-lifestyle-arts-and-entertainment-new-york-931ad6b8c320cf1ede311dc6764ee30a\">Troy Kotsur went from breakthrough to frontrunner over the past couple months\u003c/a>, winning at SAG, BAFTAs and Critics Choice and he’s likely to continue that streak come Oscar Sunday. The support for Kotsur and “CODA” has only become more enthusiastic recently and it would be a history-making win. The 53-year-old is the first deaf man to have ever been nominated for an acting prize. I’d also liked to have seen Colman Domingo get some more widespread praise for “Zola,” or Mike Faist for “West Side Story.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>COYLE: It's a very likeable group of performers but Kotsur has this one in the bag. I think it will be one of the night's best moments, not just because of the historic nature of Kotsur's win, but because it's just reward for an actor who has long toiled and thrived on Los Angeles stages. Hinds was, though, fabulous in “Belfast” and the unnominated Richard Jenkins in “The Humans” was also about as good as it gets. \u003c/p>\u003cp>BEST DIRECTOR\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Nominees: Kenneth Branagh, “Belfast”; Ryûsuke Hamaguchi, “Drive My Car”; Paul Thomas Anderson, “Licorice Pizza”; Jane Campion, “The Power of the Dog”; Steven Spielberg, “West Side Story.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>COYLE: Campion has long been the frontrunner. For the trailblazing filmmaker, who nearly three decades ago became only the second woman nominated in this category, it’s a coronation long in coming. Campion, the first woman ever to be twice nominated for best director, will win, and her cinematographer, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/oscars-entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-new-zealand-jane-campion-38f993ca3f60cb20f4a9e3ede5693011\">Ari Wegner\u003c/a>, will become the first woman to win that award — a triumph that should have happened long ago for women behind the camera. \u003c/p>\u003cp>BAHR: Yes, but will she thank Sam Elliott?\u003c/p>\u003cp>DOCUMENTARY\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Nominees: “Ascension”; “Attica”; “Flee”; “Summer of Soul (Or, When The Revolution Could Not Be Televised)”; “Writing With Fire.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>BAHR: Though Questlove is much-beloved by the Academy and his documentary \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-music-lifestyle-arts-and-entertainment-c58e5c5c0efdd19d95a8da3c3cd07c1b\">“Summer of Soul,” which won at the BAFTAs, would be more than deserving\u003c/a>, “Flee” likely has the advantage here since it was also nominated in the animated feature category. Also, while “Attica” director Stanley Nelson won the Directors Guild award, that group is narrower than the Academy’s voting body.\u003c/p>\u003cp>COYLE: To quote the Roots, Questlove's Oscar has “got to be, got to be reality.” Don't get me wrong, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-entertainment-europe-new-york-migration-e58d5536f87b70af52c8ced2711dc265\">“Flee” is a singularly exquisite film\u003c/a>, and this could indeed be close. But “Summer of Soul” might be the most universally adored film of the year. Both its uncovering of a lost Black history and its celebration of live performance were so profoundly suited to 2021. I can't see it not winning. \u003c/p>\u003cp>INTERNATIONAL FEATURE\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Nominees: “Drive My Car,” Japan; “Flee,” Denmark; “The Hand of God,” Italy; “Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom,” Bhutan; “The Worst Person in the World,” Norway.\u003c/p>\u003cp>COYLE: Ryûsuke Hamaguchi’s \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/academy-awards-entertainment-lifestyle-arts-and-entertainment-movies-35dd430836840fbd2cd4e7bdbdb69499\">“Drive My Car\" is a not-crazy best-picture underdog\u003c/a>, which makes it a heavyweight in this category. There's stiff competition here — particularly from \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-europe-arts-and-entertainment-new-york-movies-16399028267b9f730055f4e1a2f923e4\"> Joachim Trier's supremely lovely “The Worst Person in the World.”\u003c/a> But Hamaguchi's three-hour masterwork — a profound movie about art and dialogue as a means of human connection — should win.\u003c/p>\u003cp>BAHR: “Drive My Car” definitely has the advantage. The picture and director nominations probably helped convince a few more voting members to give it a chance, too. It's hard not to wonder just how far it could have gone had it had the awards campaign budgets of some of its best picture brethren. \u003c/p>\u003cp>ANIMATED FEATURE\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Nominees: “Encanto”; “Flee”; “Luca”; “The Mitchells vs. the Machines”; “Raya and the Last Dragon.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>BAHR: “Encanto” is certainly the juggernaut in this category, with the triple threat of Disney, Lin-Manuel Miranda and a massive hit song that \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-lifestyle-travel-academy-awards-movies-ab20cdddb782b62e0f491c3f5b940d25\"> we won’t talk about here (no, no, no)\u003c/a>. And under normal circumstances it’d be the easy frontrunner, but Disney has not had a good few weeks not to mention the fact that the studio has three nominations in the category which could split votes. Plus, there is massive industry goodwill for “The Mitchells vs the Machines” and it won the Annie award, which is why I think there may be a (good) upset in store.\u003c/p>\u003cp>COYLE: I think “The Mitchells vs the Machines” pulls it off. \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/film-reviews-entertainment-reviews-arts-and-entertainment-movies-d04ad9807894c297d5860020ca463abc\">“Encanto” may be the favorite\u003c/a>, but it's a funny kind of juggernaut. The Disney release didn't make a huge impression in theaters but once it hit streaming, its songs turned it into a sensation.

But this is their earliest NCAA tourney exit since 2008.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I think slowly and surely, the Baylor family realized that maybe I do fit in here, whatever that sounds like or looks like. I think that was hard for them too. I think change is hard,” Collen said. “I’m incredibly grateful. I’m sure they’re not real happy with me right now. That’s OK, because I’m not really happy with me right now, either. ”\u003c/p>\u003cp>South Dakota, in its 10th year of Division I eligibility, is in its fourth consecutive NCAA Tournament, and fifth overall. But the Coyotes had never won a tourney game before the last few days.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Coyotes had their 11-0 lead in less than three minutes while hitting their first four shots, including two 3-pointers by Lamb. It was Sjerven made a 3-pointer on the first shot, just like in their 75-61 victory over Mississippi when leading throughout Friday in their first-round game. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Hannah started the game off with another 3, I think we all kind of smiled and relaxed a little bit,” Plitzuweit said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Just that this is fun,” Sjerven said when asked her thoughts about the fast start. “And the game of basketball is as simple as five players going at another set of five players, and not to overthink it too much and it was a fun game.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>BIG PICTURE\u003c/p>\u003cp>South Dakota: The Coyotes, who have won 11 games in a row and 27 of 28 overall, played with confidence and were fearless on the road against a perennial Top 10 team. They are the second Summit League team to make the Sweet 16 (South Dakota State in 2019). Along with the three super seniors, there were two second-year freshmen in the starting lineup. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Baylor: The Bears shot a season-low 31.5% from the field (17 of 54) and were held 30 points below their season average while scoring their fewest points since December 2015. They missed seven shots and had seven turnovers before scoring their first points. They finished with 19 turnovers, leading to 22 points for South Dakota. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>More AP coverage of March Madness: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{"type":null,"background":null},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":"bottom left","relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"MarchMadness","name":"March Madness NCAA Tournament","canonicalName":"march-madness","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-sports","name":"Sports","canonicalName":"sports","isPr":false},{"id":"Texas","name":"Texas","canonicalName":"texas","isPr":false},{"id":"Collegebasketball","name":"College basketball","canonicalName":"college-basketball","isPr":false},{"id":"SouthDakota","name":"South Dakota","canonicalName":"south-dakota","isPr":false},{"id":"state-SouhtDakota","name":"SD State Wire","canonicalName":"sd-state-wire","isPr":false},{"id":"Womenscollegebasketball","name":"Women's college basketball","canonicalName":"womens-college-basketball","isPr":false},{"id":"Waco","name":"Waco","canonicalName":"waco","isPr":false}],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"null","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null,"adUnits":null},{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:1a568f6b4eb64ab087ca22f86978f16f","shortId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:1a568f6b4eb64ab087ca22f86978f16f","allowAd":true,"borderColor":null,"brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":null,"cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","collectionTagObjs":null,"contents":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:1a568f6b4eb64ab087ca22f86978f16f","shortId":"1a568f6b4eb64ab087ca22f86978f16f","bylines":"By JOHN BOHNENKAMP","canonicalUrl":"march-madness-creighton-defeats-iowa","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":null,"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":0,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — Lauren Jensen found a new place last spring when she transferred from Iowa to Creighton.\u003c/p>\u003cp>She came back into her former home on Sunday and knocked her ex-teammates out of the women's NCAA tournament.\u003c/p>","hasTextOverlay":false,"headline":"Jensen leads Creighton past Iowa in NCAA second round","description":null,"interactiveLinkUrl":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"language":"en","leadPhotoId":"f33d893a26d04fb59e70bb2c42e23ae1","leadVideoId":null,"localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/1a568f6b4eb64ab087ca22f86978f16f","localMemberName":null,"media":[{"id":"f33d893a26d04fb59e70bb2c42e23ae1","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>Creighton guard Rachael Saunders (13) drives to the basket during the first half of a second-round game against Iowa in the NCAA women's college basketball tournament, Sunday, March 20, 2022, in Iowa City, Iowa.

Other justices have participated in arguments remotely since the court started its term in the fall and some lawyers have as well. \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-amy-coney-barrett-courts-us-supreme-court-5c24ffb572dd34a8b24f226fc2211b7a\">Justice Brett Kavanaugh participated remotely from his home after testing positive for COVID-19\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-us-supreme-court-business-health-d96c0c56d5560f89f6bdbb7284480db6\">Justice Sonia Sotomayor participated remotely from her office when coronavirus case counts were particularly high\u003c/a>.

Even the dark weeks of 2014, when the city nearly fell to Russia-backed separatists in vicious street battles, were fading into memory. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"social-embed\" id=\"se0:67cab380-8dc0-11ec-f837-ed6b10946d27\">\u003ciframe title=\"Russians keep pressure on Mariupol\" aria-label=\"Locator maps\" id=\"ap-chart-hdLnQ\" src=\"https://interactives.ap.org/embeds/hdLnQ/10/\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border:none\" height=\"494\">\u003c/iframe>\u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\u003ct.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();\u003c/script>\u003cp class=\"social-caption\"> \u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003cp>And so the first few days of the invasion had a perverse familiarity for many residents. About 100,000 people left at that time while they still could, according to Serhiy Orlov, the deputy mayor. But most stayed put, figuring they could wait out whatever came next or eventually make their way west like so many others. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I felt more fear in 2014, I don’t feel the same panic now,” Anna Efimova said as she shopped for supplies at a market on Feb. 24. “There is no panic. There’s nowhere to run, where can we run?” \u003c/p>\u003cp>That same day, a Ukrainian military radar and airfield were among the first targets of Russian artillery. Shelling and airstrikes could and did come at any moment, and people spent most of their time in shelters. Life was hardly normal, but it was livable. \u003c/p>\u003cp>By Feb. 27, that started to change, as an ambulance raced into a city hospital carrying a small motionless girl, not yet 6. Her brown hair was pulled back off her pale face with a rubber band, and her pajama pants were bloodied by Russian shelling. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Her wounded father came with her, his head bandaged. Her mother stood outside the ambulance, weeping. \u003c/p>\u003cp>As the doctors and nurses huddled around her, one gave her an injection. Another shocked her with a defibrillator. A doctor in blue scrubs, pumping oxygen into her, looked straight into the camera of an AP journalist allowed inside and cursed. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Show this to Putin,” he stormed with expletive-laced fury. “The eyes of this child and crying doctors.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>They couldn't save her. Doctors covered the tiny body with her pink striped jacket and gently closed her eyes. She now rests in the mass grave. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"50aba6b700dc4d6ab3668d3a0de5c0d5\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id=\"c5c83f3f9e3144b6b708cccbf77a93b5\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://www.janes.com/defence-news/news-detail/ukraine-conflict-the-strategic-importance-of-mariupol\">The same geography that for so long worked in Mariupol’s favor\u003c/a> had turned against it. The city stands squarely between regions controlled by the Russia-backed separatists — about 10 kilometers (six miles) to the east at the closest point — and the Crimean Peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.

The blast tore through Iliya’s legs. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The odds were against him, and increasingly against the city. The electricity went out yet again, as did most mobile networks. Without communications, medics had to guess which hospitals could still handle the wounded and which roads could still be navigated to reach them. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Iliya couldn't be saved.

Why?” his sobbing mother, Marina Yatsko, asked in the hospital hallway, as medical workers looked on helplessly.

Ukrainian television and radio were cut, and car stereos became the only link to the outside world. They played Russian news, describing a world that couldn't be further from the reality in Mariupol.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As it sunk in that there was truly no escape, the mood of the city changed. It didn’t take long for grocery store shelves to empty. Mariupol’s residents cowered by night in underground shelters and emerged by day to grab what they could before scurrying underground again. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"cc150ea559ce4b1bb75f37e15130197c\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id=\"af546c86dd864ec1901d07ceb851fe00\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>On March 6, in the way of desperate people everywhere, they turned on each other. On one street lined with darkened stores, people smashed windows, pried open metal shutters, grabbed what they could. \u003c/p>\u003cp>A man who had broken into a store found himself face to face with the furious shopkeeper, caught red-handed with a child’s rubber ball. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“You bastard, you stole that ball now.

A crowd formed at one of the roads leading away from the city, but a police officer blocked their path. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Everything is mined, the ways out of town are being shelled,” he told them. “Trust me, I have family at home, and I am also worried about them.

She wore a scarf and a cheery turquoise snowflake sweater as she roughly rubbed the tears from her face, one side at a time. Behind her, beyond the small halo of light, a small group of women and children crouched in the darkness, trembling at the explosions above. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I want my home, I want my job.

Texas' election was the debut of more restrictive voting rules the GOP raced to put on the books across the U.S. in time for the midterm elections, a push that took particular aim at mail voting that soared in popularity during the pandemic. \u003c/p>\u003cp>At least 17 other states in the coming months will cast ballots under tougher election laws, in part driven by Trump's baseless and persistent claims of rampant fraud in the 2020 election.

Some smaller counties did not provide data or respond to requests, but the 187 counties that provided full numbers to AP accounted for 85% of the 3 million people who voted in the primary.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Last week, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-elections-austin-texas-voting-f28a41bf6482c25299c99a8ea52734be\">AP reported that 27,000 ballots had been flagged in Texas for initial rejection\u003c/a>, meaning those voters still had time to “fix” their ballot for several days after the primary and have it count. But the final figures suggest most voters did not. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The most rejections were around Houston, a Democratic stronghold, where Harris County elections officials reported that nearly 7,000 mail ballots — about 19% — were discarded. During the last midterm elections in 2018, Texas’ largest county only rejected 135 mail ballots. Harris County elections officials said they received more than 8,000 calls since January from voters seeking help, which they attributed to “confusion and frustration” over the new requirements. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In the five counties won by Trump that had the most mail-in primary voters, a combined 2,006 mailed ballots were rejected, a rate of 10% of the total. In the counties won by Biden with the most mail-in voters, which include most of Texas’ biggest cities, a combined 14,020 votes were similarly rejected, which amounted to 15.7%.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In rural East Texas, Annette Young voted by mail like usual but received a surprising letter a week after the primary, informing her that the ballot never counted because it didn’t comply with a new state law requiring mail voters to include personal identification numbers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I just threw it right in the trash,” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Most of the rejected ballots, according to county election officials and the Texas secretary of state, failed to adhere to the new identification requirements. The changes were part of the sweeping overhaul to Texas' elections that Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law in October, saying at the time that “no one who is eligible to vote will be denied the opportunity to vote.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Abbott and top Texas Republicans who championed the changes have largely been silent about the high rejection rates. Abbott's office did not respond to requests seeking comment, and messages for Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Republican House Speaker Dade Phelan also went unanswered. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Republican state Sen. Paul Bettencourt, a proponent of the changes, said in an email that one issue might have been that ballot instructions printed in different ink colors — red for signature, black for identification numbers — might have left voters with the wrong impression they did not need to provide both. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Federal data on discarded mail ballots in general elections show few instances of double-digit rejection rates. The outliers include Indiana (14.5%) in 2006, Oregon (12.7%) in 2010 and New York (13.7%) in 2018, according to records from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Stewart, of MIT, said generally less is known about trends in primary elections because of lacking data. One assumption, he said, is that because primaries tend to draw the most habitual voters, they are less likely to mistakes that cause rejections. But Stewart said others believe that officials may have more time to scrutinize, and reject, ballot paperwork in low-turnout elections.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The new mail ballot requirements in Texas include listing an identification number — either a driver’s license or a Social Security number — on the ballot’s carrier envelope. That number must match the county’s records, and if a ballot is rejected, voters are given the opportunity to supply the missing information or simply cast a ballot in person instead.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It is unknown how many Texas voters whose mail ballots were rejected may have still had their vote count by deciding to just show up in person instead. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Sam Taylor, a spokesman for the Texas secretary of state, said the office did not yet have its own final comprehensive numbers on ballot rejections. He said a “significant portion” of their efforts this year will be awareness about the new mail-in rules. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We are confident we will have all the information we need to apply any lessons learned during the primary to an even more robust voter education campaign heading into the November general election,\" he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Delores Tarver Smith, 87, took no chances with a mail ballot this year. She applied in Harris County for a mail ballot Feb. 1, but when none arrived by election day, she went and voted in person. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Last Wednesday — more than a week after the primary — her absentee ballot finally showed up at her home. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I just went in person to vote, because I had to make sure my vote counted,” she said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press data journalist Aaron Kessler in Washington, reporter Nicholas Riccardi in Denver; Thomas Beaumont in Des Moines, Iowa; Jim Salter in St. Louis, Heather Hollingsworth in Mission, Kansas; Margaret Stafford in Kansas City; Andy Tubasa Field in Topeka, Kansas; Tammy Webber in Fenton, Michigan; and Kathleen Foody and Jeff McMurray in Chicago contributed to this report. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Coronado and Field are corps members for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative. \u003ca href=\"https://www.reportforamerica.org/\"> Report for America\u003c/a> is a nonprofit national service program that places journalists in local newsrooms to report on undercovered issues.\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":"2022-03-16 21:27:09","storyLayout":{"type":null,"background":null},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":"bottom left","relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":false,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"2022Midtermelections","name":"2022 Midterm elections","canonicalName":"2022-midterm-elections","isPr":false},{"id":"APInvestigations","name":"AP Investigations","canonicalName":"ap-investigations","isPr":false},{"id":"Texas","name":"Texas","canonicalName":"texas","isPr":false},{"id":"Voting","name":"Voting","canonicalName":"voting","isPr":false},{"id":"OnlyonAP","name":"Only on AP","canonicalName":"only-on-ap","isPr":false},{"id":"Generalelections","name":"General elections","canonicalName":"general-elections","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-topnews","name":"AP Top News","canonicalName":"ap-top-news","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-usnews","name":"U.S. News","canonicalName":"us-news","isPr":false},{"id":"Elections","name":"Elections","canonicalName":"elections","isPr":false}],"textColor":null,"layoutType":null,"customLayoutType":null,"styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null,"adUnits":null},{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:10a82777a3b4a6ccafc38c223b659a03","shortId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:10a82777a3b4a6ccafc38c223b659a03","allowAd":true,"borderColor":null,"brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":null,"cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","collectionTagObjs":null,"contents":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:10a82777a3b4a6ccafc38c223b659a03","shortId":"10a82777a3b4a6ccafc38c223b659a03","bylines":"By MICHAEL BIESECKER","canonicalUrl":"russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-boris-johnson-europe-united-states","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":null,"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":0,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — The massive superyacht Dilbar stretches one-and-a-half football fields in length, about as long as a World War I dreadnought.

The boat is believed to belong to Igor Sechin, a Putin ally who runs Russian oil giant Rosneft, which has been on the U.S. sanctions list since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The French Finance Ministry said in a statement that customs authorities boarded the 289-foot Amore Vero and discovered its crew was preparing for an urgent departure, even though planned repair work wasn’t finished. The $120 million boat is registered to a company that lists Sechin as its primary shareholder.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On Saturday, Italian financial police in the port of San Remo \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-boris-johnson-business-europe-7d384250bed06881e53d6ce3500cdee1\">seized the 132-foot superyacht Lena\u003c/a>, which is flagged in the British Virgin Islands. Authorities said the boat belongs to Gennady Timchenko, an oligarch close to Putin and among those sanctioned by the European Union. With an estimated net worth of $16.2 billion, Timchenko is the founder of the Volga Group, which specializes in investments in energy, transport and infrastructure assets. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The 213-foot Lady M was also \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-boris-johnson-business-europe-7d384250bed06881e53d6ce3500cdee1\">seized by the Italians\u003c/a> while moored in the Riviera port town of Imperia.

Among the world’s biggest superyachts, Nord has a market value of $500 million.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Since Friday, Italy has seized 143 million euros ($156 million) in luxury yachts and villas in some of its most picturesque destinations, including Sardinia, the Ligurian coast and Lake Como.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Most of the Russians on the annual Forbes list of billionaires have not yet been sanctioned by the United States and its allies, and their superyachts are still cruising the world’s oceans.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The evolution of oligarch yachts goes back to the tumultuous decade after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, as state oil and metals industries were sold off at rock-bottom prices, often to politically connected Russian businessmen and bankers who had provided loans to the new Russian state in exchange for the shares. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Russia’s nouveau riche began buying luxury yachts similar in size and expense to those owned by Silicon Valley billionaires, heads of state and royalty. It’s a key marker of status in Moscow and St. Petersburg, and size matters.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“No self-respecting Russian oligarch would be without a superyacht,” said William Browder, a U.S.-born and now London-based financier who worked in Moscow for years before becoming one of the Putin regime’s most vocal foreign critics. “It’s part of the rite of passage to being an oligarch. It’s just a prerequisite.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>As their fortunes ballooned, there was something of an arms race among the oligarchs, with the richest among them accumulating personal fleets of ever more lavish boats.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For example, Russian metals and petroleum magnate Roman Abramovich is believed to have bought or built at least seven of the world’s largest yachts, some of which he has since sold off to other oligarchs.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In 2010, Abramovich launched the Bermuda-flagged \u003ca href=\"https://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/eclipse\">Eclipse\u003c/a>, which at 533 feet was at the time the world’s longest superyacht. Features include a wood-burning firepit and swimming pool that transforms into a dance floor. Eclipse also boasts its own helicopter hangar and an undersea bay that reportedly holds a mini-sub.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Dennis Causier, a superyacht analyst with VesselsValue, said oligarch boats often include secret security measures worthy of a Bond villain, including underwater escape hatches, bulletproof windows and armored panic rooms.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Eclipse is equipped with all sorts of special features, including missile launchers and self-defense systems on board,” Causier said. “It has a secret submarine evacuation area and things like that.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Eclipse was soon eclipsed by Azzam, purportedly owned by the emir of Abu Dhabi, which claimed the title of longest yacht when it was launched in 2013. Three years after that, Usmanov launched \u003ca href=\"https://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/dilbar\">Dilbar\u003c/a>, which replaced another slightly smaller yacht by the same name. The new Dilbar is the world’s largest yacht by volume.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Abramovich, whose fortune is estimated at $12.4 billion, fired back last year by launching \u003ca href=\"https://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/solaris-140m\">Solaris\u003c/a>. While not as long as Eclipse or as big as Dilbar, the $600 million Bermuda-flagged boat is possibly even more luxurious. Eight stories tall, Solaris features a sleek palisade of broad teak-covered decks suitable for hosting a horde of well-heeled partygoers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But no boat is top dog for long. At least 20 superyachts are reported to be under construction in various Northern European shipyards, including a $500 million superyacht being \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jeff-bezos-yacht-dutch-bridge-a24e8696be86eb3ae5f56d8e7a648c04\">built for the American billionaire Jeff Bezos.\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s about ego,” Causier said. “They all want to have the best, the longest, the most valuable, the newest, the most luxurious.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>But, he added, the escalating U.S. and EU sanctions on Putin-aligned oligarchs and Russian banks have sent a chill through the industry, with boatbuilders and staff worried they won’t be paid. It can cost upwards of $50 million a year to crew, fuel and maintain a superyacht.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The crash of the ruble and the tanking of Moscow stock market have depleted the fortunes of Russia’s elite, with several people dropping off the list of Forbes billionaires last week. Causier said he expects some oligarch superyachts will soon quietly be listed by brokers at fire-sale prices.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The 237-foot Stella Maris, which was seen by an AP journalist docked this past week in Nice, France, was believed to be owned by Rashid Sardarov, a Russian billionaire oil and gas magnate. After publication of an earlier version of this story, AP was contacted Sunday by yacht broker Joan Plana Palao, who said his company represents a U.S. citizen from California who purchased the Stella Maris last month. He declined to disclose the name of the buyer or the person from whom the boat had been purchased.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On Thursday, the U.S. Treasury Department issued a new round of sanctions that included a \u003ca href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0628\">press release\u003c/a> touting Usmanov’s close ties to Putin and photos of Dilbar and the oligarch’s private jet, a custom-built 209-foot Airbus A340-300 passenger liner. Treasury said Usmanov’s aircraft is believed to have cost up to $500 million and is named Bourkhan, after his father. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Usmanov, whose fortune has recently shrunk to about $17 billion, criticized the sanctions. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I believe that such a decision is unfair and the reasons employed to justify the sanctions are a set of false and defamatory allegations damaging my honor, dignity and business reputation,” he said in a \u003ca href=\"https://fie.org/articles/1158\">statement\u003c/a> issued through the website of the International Fencing Federation, of which he has served as president since 2008. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Abramovich has not yet been sanctioned. Members of the British Parliament have criticized Prime Minister Boris Johnson for not going after Abramovich’s U.K.-based assets, which include the professional soccer club Chelsea. Under mounting pressure, the oligarch announced this past week he would \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-sports-soccer-europe-premier-league-907c65a988ec91fd28cfd620078935d7\">sell the $2.5 billion team\u003c/a> and give the net proceeds “for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Meanwhile, location transponders showed Solaris \u003ca href=\"https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:6570613/mmsi:310792000/imo:9819820/vessel:MY_SOLARIS\">moored in Barcelona\u003c/a>, Spain, on Saturday. \u003ca href=\"https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:371584/mmsi:310593000/imo:1009613/vessel:ECLIPSE\">Eclipse\u003c/a> set sail from St. Maarten late Thursday and is underway in the Caribbean Sea, destination undisclosed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press writer Aritz Parra in Madrid contributed to this report.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Follow AP Investigative Reporter Michael Biesecker at twitter.com/mbieseck\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Contact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org.\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{"type":null,"background":null},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":"bottom left","relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"Russia-Ukraine","name":"Russia-Ukraine war","canonicalName":"russia-ukraine","isPr":false},{"id":"VladimirPutin","name":"Vladimir Putin","canonicalName":"vladimir-putin","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-politics","name":"Politics","canonicalName":"politics","isPr":false},{"id":"BorisJohnson","name":"Boris Johnson","canonicalName":"boris-johnson","isPr":false},{"id":"APInvestigations","name":"AP Investigations","canonicalName":"ap-investigations","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-europe","name":"Europe","canonicalName":"europe","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-topnews","name":"AP Top News","canonicalName":"ap-top-news","isPr":false},{"id":"UnitedStates","name":"United States","canonicalName":"united-states","isPr":false},{"id":"EuropeanUnion","name":"European Union","canonicalName":"european-union","isPr":false}],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"null","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null,"adUnits":null},{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:7e3345485aa668c97606d4b54f9b6220","shortId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:7e3345485aa668c97606d4b54f9b6220","allowAd":true,"borderColor":null,"brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":null,"cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","collectionTagObjs":null,"contents":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:7e3345485aa668c97606d4b54f9b6220","shortId":"7e3345485aa668c97606d4b54f9b6220","bylines":"By GARANCE BURKE, MARTHA MENDOZA, JULIET LINDERMAN and MICHAEL TARM ","canonicalUrl":"artificial-intelligence-algorithm-technology-police-crime","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":null,"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":0,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>CHICAGO (AP) — Michael Williams’ wife pleaded with him to remember their fishing trips with the grandchildren, how he used to braid her hair, anything to jar him back to his world outside the concrete walls of Cook County Jail.\u003c/p>","hasTextOverlay":false,"headline":"How AI-powered tech landed man in jail with scant evidence","description":null,"interactiveLinkUrl":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"language":"en","leadPhotoId":"30b09fd23d1745e2b89cf69c5e676ec9","leadVideoId":"9c6011b26c1845e9b83d158230830356","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/7e3345485aa668c97606d4b54f9b6220","localMemberName":null,"media":[{"id":"30b09fd23d1745e2b89cf69c5e676ec9","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>Michael Williams sits for a portrait in his South Side Chicago home Tuesday, July 27, 2021.

Prosecutors said technology powered by a secret algorithm that analyzed noises detected by the sensors indicated Williams shot and killed the man.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“I kept trying to figure out, how can they get away with using the technology like that against me?” said Williams, speaking publicly for the first time about his ordeal. “That’s not fair.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Williams sat behind bars for nearly a year before a judge dismissed the case against him last month at the request of prosecutors, who said they had insufficient evidence.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Williams’ experience highlights the real-world impacts of society’s growing reliance on algorithms to help make consequential decisions about many aspects of public life. Nowhere is this more apparent than in law enforcement, which has turned to technology companies like gunshot detection firm ShotSpotter to battle crime. ShotSpotter evidence has increasingly been admitted in court cases around the country, now totaling some 200. ShotSpotter’s website says it’s “a leader in precision policing technology solutions” that helps stop gun violence by using “sensors, algorithms and artificial intelligence” to classify 14 million sounds in its proprietary database as gunshots or something else.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But an Associated Press investigation, based on a review of thousands of internal documents, emails, presentations and confidential contracts, along with interviews with dozens of public defenders in communities where ShotSpotter has been deployed, has identified a number of serious flaws in using ShotSpotter as evidentiary support for prosecutors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP’s investigation found the system can miss live gunfire right under its microphones, or misclassify the sounds of fireworks or cars backfiring as gunshots. Forensic reports prepared by ShotSpotter’s employees have been used in court to improperly claim that a defendant shot at police, or provide questionable counts of the number of shots allegedly fired by defendants. Judges in a number of cases have thrown out the evidence.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>ShotSpotter’s proprietary algorithms are the company’s primary selling point, and it frequently touts the technology in marketing materials as virtually foolproof. But the company guards how its closed system works as a trade secret, a black box largely inscrutable to the public, jurors and police oversight boards.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The company’s methods for identifying gunshots aren’t always guided solely by the technology. ShotSpotter employees can, and often do, change the source of sounds picked up by its sensors after listening to audio recordings, introducing the possibility of human bias into the gunshot detection algorithm. Employees can and do modify the location or number of shots fired at the request of police, according to court records. And in the past, city dispatchers or police themselves could also make some of these changes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Amid a nationwide debate over racial bias in policing, privacy and civil rights advocates say ShotSpotter’s system and other algorithm-based technologies used to set everything from prison sentences to probation rules lack transparency and oversight and show why the criminal justice system shouldn’t outsource some of society’s weightiest decisions to computer code.\u003c/p>\u003cp>When pressed about potential errors from the company’s algorithm, ShotSpotter CEO Ralph Clark declined to discuss specifics about their use of artificial intelligence, saying it’s “not really relevant.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The point is anything that ultimately gets produced as a gunshot has to have eyes and ears on it,” said Clark in an interview. “Human eyes and ears, OK?” \u003c/p>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cp>This story, supported by the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting, is part of an ongoing Associated Press series, “Tracked,” that investigates the power and consequences of decisions driven by algorithms on people’s everyday lives.\u003c/p>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cp>A GAME CHANGER\u003c/p>\u003cp>Police chiefs call ShotSpotter a game-changer. The technology, which has been installed in about 110 American cities, large and small, can cost up to \u003ca href=\"https://www.shotspotter.com/system/content-uploads/ShotSpotter_Fact_Sheet_-_final_draft_12.13.pdf\">$95,000 per square mile per\u003c/a> year. The system is usually placed at the request of local officials in neighborhoods deemed to be the highest risk for gun violence, which are often disproportionately Black and Latino communities. Law enforcement officials say it helps get officers to crime scenes quicker and helps cash-strapped public safety agencies better deploy their resources.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“ShotSpotter has turned into one of the most important cogs in our wheel of addressing gun violence,” said Toledo, Ohio Police Chief George Kral during a 2019 International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in Chicago.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Researchers who took a look at ShotSpotter’s impacts in communities where it is used came to a different conclusion. \u003ca href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33929640/\">One study\u003c/a> published in April in the peer-reviewed Journal of Urban Health examined ShotSpotter in 68 large, metropolitan counties from 1999 to 2016, the largest review to date. It found that the technology didn’t reduce gun violence or increase community safety.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The evidence that we’ve produced suggests that the technology does not reduce firearm violence in the long-term, and the implementation of the technology does not lead to increased murder or weapons related arrests,” said lead author Mitch Doucette.\u003c/p>\u003cp>ShotSpotter installs its acoustic sensors on buildings, telephone poles and street lights. Employees in a dark, restricted-access room study hundreds of thousands of gunfire alerts on multiple computer screens at the company’s headquarters about 35 miles (56 kilometers) south of San Francisco or a newer office in Washington.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Forensic tools such as DNA and ballistics evidence used by prosecutors have had their methodologies examined in painstaking detail for decades, but ShotSpotter claims its software is proprietary, and won’t release its algorithm. The company’s privacy policy says sensor locations aren’t divulged to police departments, although community members can see them on their street lamps. The company has shielded internal data and records revealing the system’s inner workings, leaving defense attorneys no way of interrogating the technology to understand the specifics of how it works.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We have a constitutional right to confront all witnesses and evidence against us, but in this case the ShotSpotter system is the accuser, and there is no way to determine if it’s accurate, monitored, calibrated or if someone’s added something,” said Katie Higgins, a defense attorney who has successfully fought ShotSpotter evidence. “The most serious consequence is being convicted of a crime you didn’t commit using this as evidence.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Silicon Valley startup launched 25 years ago backed by venture capitalist Gary Lauder, heir to Estée Lauder’s makeup fortune. Today, the billionaire remains the company’s largest investor. \u003c/p>\u003cp>ShotSpotter’s profile has grown in recent years.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The U.S. government has spent more than $6.9 million on gunshot detection systems, including ShotSpotter, in discretionary grants and earmarked funds, the Justice Department said in response to questions from AP. States and local governments have spent millions more, from a separate pool of federal tax dollars, to purchase the system.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The company’s share price has more than doubled since it went public in 2017 and it posted revenue of nearly $30 million in the first half of 2021. It’s hardly ubiquitous, however. ShotSpotter's website lists 119 communities in the U.S., the Caribbean and South Africa where it operates. The company says it has deployed 18,000 sensors covering 810 square miles (2,100 square kilometers).\u003c/p>\u003cp>In 2018, it acquired a predictive policing company called HunchLab, which integrates its AI models with ShotSpotter’s gunshot detection data to purportedly predict crime before it happens.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That system can “forecast when and where crimes are likely to emerge and recommends specific patrols and tactics that can deter these events,” according to the company’s 2020 \u003ca href=\"https://ir.shotspotter.com/all-sec-filings/content/0001564590-21-016134/0001564590-21-016134.pdf\">annual report\u003c/a> filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company said it plans to expand in Latin America and other regions of the world. It recently appointed Roberta Jacobson, the former U.S. ambassador to Mexico, to its board.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Late last year, a Trump administration commission on law enforcement urged increased funding for systems like ShotSpotter to “combat firearm crime and violence.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>And amid rising homicides, this spring, the Biden administration nominated David Chipman, a former ShotSpotter executive, to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In June, President Joe Biden encouraged mayors to use American Rescue Plan funds — aimed at speeding up the U.S. pandemic recovery — to buy gunshot detection systems, “to better see and stop gun violence in their communities.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>‘SOMETHING IN ME HAD JUST DIED’\u003c/p>\u003cp>On a balmy Sunday evening in May 2020, Williams and his wife Jacqueline Anderson settled in at their apartment building on Chicago’s South Side. They fed their Rottweiler Lily and German shepherd Shibey. Anderson fell asleep. Williams said he left the house to buy cigarettes at a gas station.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Looters had beaten him to it. Six days before in Minneapolis, George Floyd had been killed by police Officer Derek Chauvin. Four hundred miles away (640 kilometers), in Williams’ neighborhood, outrage boiled over. Shops were torn up, store windows broken, fires burned.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Williams found the gas station destroyed, so he said he made a U-turn to head home on South Stony Island Avenue. Before he reached East 63rd Street, Williams said Safarian Herring, a 25-year-old he said he had seen around the neighborhood, waved him down for a ride.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I didn’t feel threatened or anything because I’ve seen him before, around. So, I said yes. And he got in the front seat, and we took off,” Williams said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>According to documents AP obtained through an open records request, Williams told police that as he approached an intersection another vehicle pulled up beside his car. A man in the front passenger seat fired a shot. The bullet missed Williams, but hit his passenger.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It shocked me so badly, the only thing I can do was slump down in my car,” he said. As Herring bled all over the seat from wounds to the side of his head, Williams ran a red light to escape.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I was hollering to my passenger ‘Are you ok?’” said Williams. “He didn’t respond.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Williams drove his passenger to St. Bernard Hospital, where medical workers rushed Herring into the emergency room and doctors fought to save his life.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Two weeks before being picked up by Williams, Samona Nicholson, Herring’s mother, said the aspiring chef had survived a shooting at a bus stop. Nicholson, who called her son ‘Pook,’ arranged for him to stay with a relative where she thought he’d be safe.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Doctors pronounced Herring dead on June 2, 2020, at 2:53 p.m.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For days after the shooting Williams’ wife said he curled up on his bed, having flashbacks and praying for his passenger.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Three months after Herring’s death, the police showed up. Williams recalls officers told him they wanted to take him to the station to talk and assured him he did nothing wrong.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He had a criminal history and spent three different stints behind bars, for attempted murder, robbery and discharging a firearm, records show.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That was all when he was a younger man. Williams said he had moved on with life, avoiding legal trouble since his last release more than 15 years ago and working numerous jobs.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At the police station, detectives interrogated him about the night Herring was shot, then took him to a holding cell.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“They just said that they were charging me with first-degree murder,” Williams said. “When he told me that, it was just like something in me had just died.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“IT’S NOT PERFECT”\u003c/p>\u003cp>On the night Williams stepped out for cigarettes, ShotSpotter sensors triangulated a loud noise the system initially assigned to 5700 S. Lake Shore Dr. near Chicago’s historic Museum of Science and Industry alongside Lake Michigan, according to an alert the company sent to police.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That material anchored the prosecutor’s theory that Williams shot Herring inside his car, even though the case supplementary report from police did not cite a motive, nor did it mention any eyewitnesses. There was no gun found at the scene of the crime.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Prosecutors also leaned on a surveillance video viewed by AP showing that Williams’ car ran a red light, as did another car that appeared to have its windows up. This detail ruled out the possibility that the shot came from the other car’s passenger window, they said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Chicago police did not respond to AP’s request for comment. The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office said in a statement that after careful review prosecutors “concluded that the totality of the evidence was insufficient to meet our burden of proof,\" but did not answer specific questions about the case. \u003c/p>\u003cp>As ShotSpotter’s gunshot detection systems expand around the country, so has its use as forensic evidence in the courtroom — some 200 times in 20 states since 2010, with 91 of those cases in the past three years, the company said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Our data compiled with our expert analysis help prosecutors make convictions,” said a recent ShotSpotter press release. Even during the pandemic, ShotSpotter participated in 18 court cases, some over Zoom, according to a recent company presentation to investors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But even as its use has expanded in court, ShotSpotter’s technology has drawn scrutiny.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For one, the algorithm that analyzes sounds to distinguish gunshots from other noises has never been peer reviewed by outside academics or experts.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The concern about ShotSpotter being used as direct evidence is that there are simply no studies out there to establish the validity or the reliability of the technology. Nothing,” said Tania Brief, a staff attorney at The Innocence Project, a nonprofit that seeks to reverse wrongful convictions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://njdc.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Shot-Spotter-Gunshot-Location-System-Efficacy-Study.pdf\">A 2011 study\u003c/a> commissioned by the company found that dumpsters, trucks, motorcycles, helicopters, fireworks, construction, trash pickup and church bells have all triggered false positive alerts, mistaking these sounds for gunshots. Clark said the company is constantly improving its audio classifications, but the system still logs a small percentage of false positives.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the past, these false alerts — and lack of alerts — have prompted cities from Charlotte, North Carolina, to San Antonio, Texas, to end their ShotSpotter contracts, the AP found. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In Fall River, Massachusetts, police said ShotSpotter worked less than 50% of the time and missed all seven shots in a downtown murder in 2018. The results didn’t improve over time, and later that year ShotSpotter turned off its system.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The public school district in Fresno, California, ended its ShotSpotter contract last year, after paying $1.25 million over four years and finding it too costly. Also, parents and board members were concerned that district funds meant to help high-needs students were used to pay for ShotSpotter, said school board trustee Genoveva Islas.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We were at the point where George Floyd had been murdered and there was a lot of push around racism and discrimination in the district. There was this mounting questioning about that investment in particular,” Islas said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some courts, too, have been less than impressed with the ShotSpotter system. In 2014, a judge in Richmond, California, didn’t allow ShotSpotter evidence to be used during a gang murder conspiracy case, although the accused man, Todd Gillard, was still convicted of being involved in a drive-by shooting.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The expert testimony that a gun was fired at a particular location at a given time, based on the ShotSpotter technology, is not presently admissible in court, because it has not, at this point, reached general acceptance in the relevant scientific community,” ruled Contra Costa Superior Court Judge John Kennedy. ShotSpotter later provided AP with additional court records showing that three years later, Kennedy reconsidered admissibility of the ShotSpotter evidence, and found that it could be admitted.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In a Chicago case, prosecutors had surveillance videos of gang member Ernesto Godinez in a neighborhood where an ATF agent was shot after dark — but none showing him actually shooting a gun. At a 2019 trial, they entered ShotSpotter data to show gunshots originated from the location where video evidence indicated Godinez was when shots rang out. This month, a federal appeals court ruled that a trial judge erred by not vetting the reliability of ShotSpotter data before letting jurors hear it. Nonetheless, the split three-judge panel concluded that other evidence prosecutors presented was enough to uphold Godinez’s conviction.\u003c/p>\u003cp>ShotSpotter says it’s constantly fine-tuning its machine learning model to recognize what is and isn’t a gunshot sound by getting detectives and investigators to add crime scene observations to its system. As a part of that process, which they call “ground truth,” ShotSpotter asks patrol officers to add and notate shell casings, bullet holes, gather witness testimony and other “evidence of gunfire” using its software.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We have the opportunity to make the machine classification better and better and better because we get real-world feedback loops from humans,” Clark said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Several experts warned that training an algorithm based on a set of observations submitted by police risks contaminating the model if harried officers — perhaps inadvertently — feed it incomplete or incorrect data.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’m kind of aghast,” said Clare Garvie, a senior associate with the Center on Privacy &amp; Technology at Georgetown Law. “You are building an inherent uncertainty into that system, and you are telling that system it’s fine. You are contaminating the reliability of your system.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>ShotSpotter said the more data it receives from police, the more accurate its model becomes. The company says their system is accurate 97% of the time.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“In the small number of cases where ShotSpotter is incorrect, providing feedback to the algorithm can improve accuracy,” the company said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Beyond the ShotSpotter algorithm, other questions have been raised about how the company operates.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Court records show that in some cases, employees have changed sounds detected by the system to say that they are gunshots.\u003c/p>\u003cp>During 2016 testimony in a Rochester, New York, officer-involved shooting trial, ShotSpotter’s engineer Paul Greene was pressed to explain why one of its employees reclassified sounds from a helicopter to a bullet. The reason? He said its customer, in this case the Rochester Police Department, told them to.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The prosecutor in that case replied: “Is that something that occurs in the regular course of business at ShotSpotter?”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Yes, it is. It happens all the time,” said Greene. “Typically, you know, we trust our law enforcement customers to be really upfront and honest with us.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Testifying in a 2017 San Francisco murder trial, Greene gave similar testimony that an analyst had moved the location of its initial alert a block away, suddenly matching the scene of the crime.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s not perfect. The dot on the map is simply a starting point,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the Williams case, evidence in pretrial hearings shows that ShotSpotter initially said the noise the sensor picked up was a firecracker, a classification the company’s algorithm made with 98% confidence. But a ShotSpotter employee relabeled the noise as a gunshot.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Later, ShotSpotter senior technical support engineer Walter Collier changed the reported Chicago address of the sound to the street where Williams was driving, about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) away, according to court documents. ShotSpotter said Collier corrected the report to match the actual location that the sensors had identified. The company later provided AP with a copy of the full real-time alert, which contained a street address, location maps and latitude and longitude coordinates as did the second, detailed forensic analysis Collier prepared. The assigned street address changed from the first to the second report, but the location identified on the maps and GPS coordinates in both reports remained around the same intersection.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Collier worked for the Chicago Police Department for more than two decades before joining ShotSpotter, according to his LinkedIn profile. After Williams was sent to jail, his attorney requested more information about Collier’s training. The attorney, Brendan Max, said he was shocked by the company’s response.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In court filings, ShotSpotter acknowledged: “Our experts are trained using a variety of ‘on the job’ training sessions, and transfer of knowledge from our scientists and other experienced employees. As such no official or formal training materials exist for our forensic experts.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Law enforcement officials in Chicago continue to stand by their use of ShotSpotter. \u003ca href=\"http://ecm.chicago.gov/eSMARTContracts/service/dpsweb/ViewDPSWeb.zul\">Chicago’s three-year, $33 million contract,\u003c/a> signed ​​in 2018, makes the city ShotSpotter’s largest customer. ShotSpotter has been at the heart of the police department’s “intelligence-action cycle” for predictive policing that uses gunshot alerts to “identify areas of risk,” according to a presentation obtained by AP.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Late last month, on July 22, Attorney General Merrick Garland flew to Chicago to announce a new initiative to combat gun violence and toured a police precinct, looking on as officials showed him how they use ShotSpotter.\u003c/p>\u003cp>INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\u003c/p>\u003cp>The next day, Williams hobbled into Courtroom 500 leaning on his wooden cane, dressed in tan jail garb and sandals, as a sheriff’s deputy towered over him. He had been locked up for 11 months.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Williams lifted his head to the famously irascible Judge Vincent Gaughan. The 79-year-old Vietnam veteran looked back from high on his bench and told Williams his case was dismissed. The reason: insufficient evidence.\u003c/p>\u003cp>ShotSpotter maintains it had warned prosecutors not to rely on its technology to detect gunshots fired inside vehicles or buildings. The company said the disclaimer can be found in the small print \u003ca href=\"https://webapps1.chicago.gov/vcsearch/city/vendors/102512086A\">embedded in its contract \u003c/a> with Chicago police.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the company declined to say at what point during Williams’ nearly yearlong incarceration it got in touch with prosecutors, or why it prepared a forensic report for a gunshot that allegedly was fired in Williams’ vehicle, given the fact that the system had trouble identifying gunshots in enclosed spaces. The report itself contained contradictory information suggesting the technology did, in fact, work inside cars. Clark, the company’s CEO, declined to comment on the case, but in a follow-up statement, the company equivocated, telling AP that under “certain conditions,” the system can actually pick up gunshots inside vehicles.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Max, Williams’ attorney, said prosecutors never disclosed any of this information to him, and instead dropped charges two months after he subpoenaed ShotSpotter for the company’s correspondence with state’s attorneys.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The judge agreed to schedule a hearing in the coming weeks about whether to release ShotSpotter’s operating protocol and other documents the company wants to keep secret. Max, who requested it, said such material could be used to cast doubt on the validity and reliability of ShotSpotter evidence in cases nationwide.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“My client did not deserve to have his liberty taken away based on unscientific, unproven evidence,” Max said. “Given the history of flawed forensic evidence in our courts, we can’t let ShotSpotter be the next thing that racks up wrongful convictions.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>On the evening of July 23, Williams walked out of Cook County Jail into the hot Chicago night. \u003c/p>\u003cp>He was picked up by his attorney, and Anderson, his wife of 20 years, was waiting at home. When her husband stepped out of his attorney’s car, she took him in her arms and cried.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That first night at home, Anderson made ribs and chicken, cornbread and macaroni and cheese.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But Williams couldn’t eat on his own. He’d beat COVID-19 twice while in jail, but had developed an uncontrollable tremor in his hand that kept him from holding a spoon. So Anderson fed him. And as they sat together on the couch, she held onto his arm to try and stop the shaking.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For her part, Herring’s mother believes police had the right suspect in Williams. She blames ShotSpotter for botching the case by passing on, then withdrawing what she called flimsy data.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Williams remains shaken by his ordeal. He said he doesn’t feel safe in his hometown anymore. When he walks through the neighborhood he scans for the little microphones that almost sent him to prison for life.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The only places these devices are installed are in poor Black communities, nowhere else,” he said. “How many of us will end up in this same situation?\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cp>This story was originally published on August 19, 2021. The Associated Press reported that a ShotSpotter engineer changed the reported Chicago address of a sound the company labeled a gunshot to the street where Michael Williams was driving. The story included ShotSpotter’s explanation that the engineer had corrected the street address that was generated in its initial real-time alert to match the actual street address that the company’s sensors had identified. The company has now provided the AP with a copy of the full real-time alert. The two reports the company issued – the initial real-time alert and the detailed forensic analysis later filed in court – contained a street address, location maps and latitude and longitude coordinates. The assigned street address changed from the first to the second report, but the location identified on the maps and GPS coordinates in both reports remained around the same intersection. ShotSpotter says the street address in the initial real-time alert sent to police was wrong because the GPS coordinates fell within a large park for which the officially designated address was about a mile away from the actual location identified by the sensors. In addition, the AP story misstated the status of an attorney who pressed a ShotSpotter engineer testifying in a trial to explain why one of its employees reclassified sounds from a helicopter to a bullet. The article said the attorney was a defense attorney but he was actually a prosecutor.

There are small shops with food and coffee. Men sell stolen gasoline and drugs. Strangers are filmed with cell phones. The power poles lining the highway farther north have been blasted with large-caliber weapons. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Most who disappeared here were truck drivers, cabbies, but also at least one family and various U.S. citizens. About a dozen have been found alive.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"944b6df1857a4d3a9d1a2bc7db13ab75\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id=\"2bda523818c84bc9b051306599cb9202\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id=\"33deff8b66e84bfeb6a4f83e5c6c79aa\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Last July, Karla Quintana, head of the National Search Commission, said the disappearances appeared to be related to a dispute between the Jalisco New Generation cartel, which was trying to enter the area, and the Northeast cartel, which wanted to keep them out. It’s not clear if the victims were smugglers of drugs or people, if some were abducted mistakenly or if the goal was simply to generate terror.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The phenomenon of Mexico’s disappearances exploded in 2006 when the government declared war on the drug cartels. For years, the government looked the other way as violence increased and families of the missing were forced to become detectives.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It wasn’t until 2018 -- the end of the last administration -- that a law passed, laying the legal foundations for the government to establish the National Search Commission. There followed local commissions in every state; protocols that separated searches from investigations, and a temporary and independent body of national and international technical experts supported by the U.N. to help clear the backlog of unidentified remains.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The official total of the missing stands at 98,356. Even without the civil wars or military dictatorships that afflicted other Latin American countries, Mexico’s disappeared are exceeded in the region only by war-torn Colombia. Unlike other countries, Mexico's challenge still has no end: authorities and families search for people who disappeared in the 1960s and those who went missing today. \u003c/p>\u003cp>President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's government was the first to recognize the extent of the problem, to talk of “extermination sites” and to mount effective searches. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But he also promised in 2019 that authorities would have all the resources they needed. The national commission, which was supposed to have 352 employees this year, still has just 89. And Macías’ state commission has 22 positions budgeted, but has only filled a dozen slots. There the issue isn’t money; the difficulty is finding applicants who pass background checks.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Disappearances are considered the perfect crime because without a body, there’s no crime. And the cartels are expert at ensuring that there is no body.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“If a criminal group has total control of an area they do what we call ‘kitchens,’ because they feel comfortable” burning bodies openly, Macías said. “In areas that are not theirs and where the other side could easily see the smoke, they dig graves.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In 2009, at the other end of the border, a member of the Tijuana cartel confessed to having “cooked” some 300 victims in caustic lye. Eight years later, a report from a public university investigation center showed that what officially had been a jail in the border city of Piedras Negras, was actually a Zetas command center and crematorium.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"02732c3ec9a34b8b81e9b7b330c20136\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id=\"9b6312cdb73c4ed6bcedfb3b2a1cae81\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id=\"8a87ee4bc27a4a37a53ef528af1a78c8\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Perhaps the largest such site was yet another border setting near the mouth of the Rio Grande called “the dungeon,” in territory controlled by the Gulf cartel. The memory still stirs Macías. The first time he went he saw “pelvis, skulls, femurs, everything just lying there and I said to myself, ‘It can’t be.’”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Authorities have recovered more than 1,100 pounds of bones at the site so far. \u003c/p>\u003cp>According to the Tamaulipas state forensic service, some 15 “extermination sites” have been found. There are also burial sites: In 2010, graves containing 191 bodies were found along one of the main migratory routes through Tamaulipas to the border. In 2014, 43 students disappeared in the southern state of Guerrero. Only three have been identified from pieces of burnt bones.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Most of the extermination sites have been found by family members who follow up leads themselves with or without the support and protection of authorities. Such search groups exist in nearly every state. \u003c/p>\u003cp>For the families, the discoveries inspire both hope and pain.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It brings together a lot of emotions,” said a woman who has been searching for her husband since 2014 and two brothers who disappeared later. Like thousands of relatives across Mexico, she has made the search for her loved ones her life. “It makes you happy to find (a site), but at the moment you see things the way they are, you nosedive.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The woman, who requested anonymity because of safety concerns, was present for the discovery of two sites last year. When she entered the Nuevo Laredo location with Macías, she could only cry.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A few months earlier, she had found the site in central Tamaulipas where she believes her loved ones are. That day, accompanied by the state search commission and escorted by the National Guard, they entered the brush in search of a drug camp.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’m not well psychologically after that,” she said as she showed photos of the deep graves where burnt remains were buried, some wrapped in barbed wire. They recovered around a thousand teeth, she said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>On a recent day in Nuevo Laredo, gloved hands sifted through the dirt, separating out bits of bone: a piece of a jaw, a skull fragment, a vertebra. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The work is hard. The forensic technicians clear brush and then dig. Some days the temperature hovers around freezing, others it’s above 100 degrees. They wear head-to-toe white protective suits and are constantly guarded. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Security is a concern, and so authorities have separated the search function from the investigations -- the cartels appear less concerned with those just looking for bones, though anything they find could eventually become evidence in a prosecution. Each day before dusk, they are escorted to a safe house and don’t leave except to return the next day to the site. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"517b7960451a4067a3b2276c3af02a4a\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>When cartel violence exploded in Tamaulipas in 2010, the capital’s morgue had space for six bodies. In a single massacre that year, a cartel killed 72 migrants. In those days, the Interamerican Commission of Human Rights denounced serious negligence in Tamaulipas’s forensic work. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Pedro Sosa, director of the state’s forensic services, said that their way of working changed radically in 2018 with the establishment of the identification team. But it’s not enough. “A single forensic anthropologist in the whole state is not compatible with all of this work.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>It can take four months for the Nuevo Laredo remains to be cleaned, processed and arrive to the genetic lab. It can take longer if something urgent emerges like in January of last year, when nearly 20 people -- mostly migrants -- were incinerated in an attack near the border. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Even if they manage to extract DNA, identification isn’t assured because the profile will only automatically be crossed with a state database. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It could be years before the profile is added to one of the national databases.

Years of delays and canceled tenders ensued.

While natural gas causes sizable emissions of climate-warming gases, it burns more cleanly than coal and oil and could play a big role in a low-carbon future for Kuwait. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Kuwait’s 63 trillion cubic feet meters of gas reserves, 1% of the world’s total, remain largely untapped. Fields shared with Saudi Arabia in what’s known as the neutral zone shut down for years as the countries sparred over land use.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The elected parliament, which views itself as a defender of Kuwait’s natural resources against foreign companies and corrupt businessmen, frequently hampers gas exploration. Lawmakers long have sought to challenge the government’s authority to award lucrative energy contracts, summoning oil ministers for interrogations on suspicion of mismanagement and stalling major projects.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The legislature similarly carries the mantle of preserving Kuwait’s lavish welfare state, believing the government lacks accountability.

As the coronavirus ravaged the U.S., the then-vice president praised the administration’s response. And after a violent mob threatened his life during an attack on the U.S. Capitol, Pence rejected entreaties to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But after years of being a subservient sidekick, Pence is beginning to distance himself from Trump as he takes increasingly overt steps toward a White House bid of his own.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Last month, Pence called out Trump by name, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mike-pence-donald-trump-election-2020-84ff467d9ff5bfaad084e274f69ac521\">saying his former boss was “wrong”\u003c/a> to insist that he had the power to unilaterally overturn the results of the 2020 election — a power vice presidents do not possess. In \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-europe-elections-donald-trump-fae55c9c736a34bfccf4e6143833b510\">a separate speech\u003c/a> before top Republican donors, Pence urged the GOP to move on from Trump's 2020 grievances and declared “there is no room in this party for apologists\" for Vladimir Putin after Trump praised the Russian leader's maneuvering as “genius\" before his brutal invasion of Ukraine.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='afs:Card:393483284474' class='hub-peek-embed'>Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) \u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>The moves show how Pence, a former congressman and Indiana governor, is working to craft a political identity independent of his former boss. The strategy carries substantial risk in a party still dominated by Trump and his lie that the 2020 election was stolen. But if Pence successfully navigates this moment, it could offer a model for Republicans to benefit from their work with Trump without being tied to his most toxic behavior, which has consistently hurt the party with crucial suburban voters who often determine elections. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“When you’re in the role of vice president, there’s certain opportunities that affords and certainly certain constraints,” Marc Short, who served as Pence’s chief of staff at the White House, said of Pence's recent moves. “You sort of assume a different identity for those four years because your job is to support the president and what he’s doing.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Aides stress that Pence, who spent decades in conservative radio and politics before joining Trump’s ticket in 2016, has a host of views and principles that are deeply held, including some that deviate from Trump’s. They expect him to frequently invoke those views, including his fierce opposition to abortion rights, as he campaigns for Republicans ahead of this year's midterms.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>They note in particular that Pence has long been a critic of Putin, and expect him to keep speaking out on Ukraine. In a trip that seemed to cast Pence with a presidential aura, he made an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian border with Poland shortly after the invasion, where he crossed into Ukraine and helped deliver aid to the flood of refugees who were escaping the war.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Rev. Franklin Graham, the evangelist and president of Samaritan’s Purse, the international Christian relief organization that organized Pence’s visit to the Ukrainian border, said Pence’s evolution was a natural one.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“People are seeing the real Mike Pence. As vice president, you have to toe the line of the president and you have to be in step with everything the president says,” Graham said. Now, “people are seeing who he is and what he’s standing for and what he says. So it’s not repeating what the president says. It’s saying what he believes. ... He’s speaking for himself now and not President Trump.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Pence has spent the past several months traveling the country, delivering policy speeches, raising money for midterm candidates and visiting early-voting states, while working on a pair of books. In the coming months, he is planning a return visit to Iowa, which holds the party’s first nominating contests of the presidential election cycle, as well as two visits to South Carolina, another early-voting state. \u003c/p>\u003cp>His political group, Advancing American Freedom, announced a $10 million ad campaign targeting congressional Democrats and urging them to support an expansion of American energy production in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. And he is preparing to release a new “Freedom Agenda” aimed at providing candidates a positive policy agenda that makes clear to voters what Republicans are not just against, but what they’re for.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He has also been spending time with top donors. Before his visit to Ukraine, Pence flew to Israel where he had dinner with former prime minister and opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu, whom Trump has \u003ca href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-netanyahu-disloyalty-fuck-him-276ac6cc-3f70-4fba-b315-c82a59603e67.html\">reportedly criticized\u003c/a>, and met with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. Pence also spent time with billionaire donor Miriam Adelson, on whose plane he flew, marking the second time the two have met in recent months.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The efforts also make clear the lane Pence could occupy if he chooses to compete in what may be a crowded 2024 GOP primary contest that could include Trump himself. While there remains a portion of the party that will never forgive him for abiding by his constitutional role on Jan. 6, allies believe that Pence could be in a unique position to merge the traditional conservative movement with successes of the Trump-Pence administration.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, early polls show that Trump remains the decisive favorite among GOP voters if he chooses to mount another run. Without Trump in the race, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis so far appears to be the early favorite.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Other potential candidates are trying to make similar moves. Mike Pompeo, who served as Trump's CIA director and secretary of state, for instance, recently traveled to Taiwan and met with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, while Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, in a high-profile speech at the Reagan Library, praised Trump’s record while also criticizing him for signing bipartisan criminal justice reform legislation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, speaking Monday at Saint Anselm College’s New Hampshire Institute of Politics, a frequent stop for presidential candidates, continued to offer his own criticism of Trump, slamming those who have spoken admiringly of Russian President Vladimir Putin and calling Trump “dead wrong about the election.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s over, everybody. You know the reason I know? Joe Biden is sleeping in Donald Trump’s bed,\" Christie said. \"And we need as a party to move forward. We can’t look backwards. We can’t be a party of vindictiveness and vendettas. We cannot be a party of settling scores ‘for me.’ We have to be a party of creating opportunity and inspiration ’for us.'″\u003c/p>\u003cp>Pence so far has been coy about his plans for the future. Asked on Fox Business whether he intended to run, Pence said all his focus currently is on 2022.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“In 2023, I’m confident the Republican Party will nominate a candidate who will be the next president of the United state of America,” he went on. “And at the right time, my family and I’ll reflect and consider how we might participate in that process.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>For now, Trump has kept mum on Pence’s attacks, unusual for someone who responds to the most minor slights. Trump’s spokesman did not respond to questions, but some speculate that the former president doesn't want to antagonize Pence before his book publishes and he begins a publicity tour. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Still Trump has made clear that his anger has not subsided.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Mike and I had a great relationship except for the very important factor that took place at the end,” Trump \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-says-pence-partnership-over-as-ex-president-eyes-2024-comeback-bid\">told the Washington Examiner\u003c/a> in an interview last week. “I haven’t spoken to him in a long time.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>He also ruled out the possibility of another Trump-Pence ticket.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I don’t think the people would accept it,” said Trump, who has mused about other vice presidential prospects.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press writer Kathy McCormack in Manchester, N.H. contributed to this report.\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":false,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"Russia-Ukraine","name":"Russia-Ukraine war","canonicalName":"russia-ukraine","isPr":false},{"id":"2022Midtermelections","name":"2022 Midterm elections","canonicalName":"2022-midterm-elections","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-politics","name":"Politics","canonicalName":"politics","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-europe","name":"Europe","canonicalName":"europe","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-topnews","name":"AP Top News","canonicalName":"ap-top-news","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-usnews","name":"U.S. News","canonicalName":"us-news","isPr":false},{"id":"Elections","name":"Elections","canonicalName":"elections","isPr":false},{"id":"DonaldTrump","name":"Donald Trump","canonicalName":"donald-trump","isPr":false},{"id":"Election2020","name":"Election 2020","canonicalName":"election-2020","isPr":false},{"id":"Campaign2016","name":"Campaign 2016","canonicalName":"campaign-2016","isPr":false}],"textColor":null,"layoutType":null,"customLayoutType":null,"styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null,"adUnits":null},{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:eebb8cbe3b0e7ae16eafefb5abc85d2d","shortId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:eebb8cbe3b0e7ae16eafefb5abc85d2d","allowAd":true,"borderColor":null,"brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":null,"cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","collectionTagObjs":null,"contents":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:eebb8cbe3b0e7ae16eafefb5abc85d2d","shortId":"eebb8cbe3b0e7ae16eafefb5abc85d2d","bylines":"By TOM MURPHY","canonicalUrl":"biden-covid-science-business-health","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":{},"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":null,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>High-risk COVID-19 patients now have new treatments they can take at home to stay out of the hospital — if doctors get the pills to them fast enough. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Health systems around the country are rushing out same-day prescription deliveries.\u003c/p>","hasTextOverlay":false,"headline":"Doctors finding hurdles to using pills to treat COVID-19","description":null,"interactiveLinkUrl":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"language":"en","leadPhotoId":"8fab2c04d92f4ec985c9e683e2f6acc2","leadVideoId":null,"localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/eebb8cbe3b0e7ae16eafefb5abc85d2d","localMemberName":null,"media":[{"id":"8fab2c04d92f4ec985c9e683e2f6acc2","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>Jeffrey Carlson stands for a portrait outside his home in Vadnais Heights, Minn., on Sunday, March 13, 2022.

A convention would open Alaska’s foundational document to any type of revision, something opponents consider dangerous in an era of deep partisan divides, culture wars and campaigns fueled by deep-pocketed donors from out of state.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Talking about changing the constitution is “like walking around in a dynamite storage room with a lighter.

The question has gained little attention in Missouri and has generated only mild interest so far in New Hampshire, where a group opposed to COVID-19 mandates and restrictions has discussed starting a campaign to advocate for a convention. That group, Rebuild NH, hasn’t yet said what amendments it might favor.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In all, 14 states are required to hold periodic elections asking voters whether to convene a constitutional convention. Delegates typically have free reign to propose revisions — or even entirely new constitutions — that would then go back to voters for ratification.\u003c/p>\u003cp>State constitutional conventions called by voters have become increasingly rare. More than 30 such ballot questions have failed since Rhode Island voters last authorized one in 1984.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Voters in New Hampshire haven’t authorized one since 1982. Delegates at that gathering debated more than 100 amendments, with 10 making it to the ballot. Voters approved six, including measures that required the legislature to meet annually instead of every other year and ensuring polling places would be accessible to disabled voters.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The country is more divided today.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“Whereas at one point a constitutional convention was seen as a way to empower the people and overcome challenges that they saw with the operation of government, the people now no longer have trust that constitutional conventions will work out,” said John Dinan, a political science professor at Wake Forest University who studies the topic. “There’s significant fear of runaway conventions or opening the Pandora’s box of issues.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>That’s what is emerging in Alaska, where some groups are taking sides on the question that will be on the November ballot.\u003c/p>\u003cp>This year’s vote will follow an expected mid-year decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in a case that could severely erode abortion rights across the country. The Alaska Supreme Court has interpreted the state constitution’s right to privacy as encompassing abortion rights, but many conservatives want to do away with that interpretation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The conservative Alaska Family Council says it considers calling for a convention one of its top priorities. It supports an amendment saying nothing in the constitution may be construed as protecting a right to abortion. The group also is supporting issues related to school choice and changes to the judicial selection process.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Existing precedent in the state provides “pretty significant insulation” for Alaska women “to continue to have reproductive choice,\" said Susan Orlansky, interim executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska. But she said her group is concerned about the potential for a convention. A convention carries the risk of possible changes to the constitution that could undermine those protections, she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A prominent advocate for a convention is Bob Bird, chair of the Alaskan Independence Party, which is one of the three recognized political parties in the state and considers itself a blend of conservative Republicanism, populism and libertarianism. Among other things, Bird has urged changes to the judiciary.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Critics of a convention say the heated political environment makes this a bad time to open the state constitution, but Bird disagrees: “If we didn’t have this environment, it wouldn’t even be considered. It would be brushed off like it has (been) in the past.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The last time the question was on the ballot in Alaska, in 2012, voters rejected calling for a convention by a nearly 2-to-1 margin.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Republican former lawmakers, including Coghill, Democratic former mayors and a union leader have joined as part of a group called Defend Our Constitution to oppose a convention. They worry that deep-pocketed outside interests will try to influence the process and that business interests might delay investments in Alaska while it plays out. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Bruce Botelho, a Democrat involved with the convention opposition group, said there are “a lot of people who are just generally angry at government and this may be their opportunity to cast a vote to express their frustrations at government.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Supporters say the fears are overblown and that if voters do approve a convention, sharply divisive issues are unlikely to go far.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Similar concerns have prevented a constitutional convention at the federal level, which several Republican-led states have proposed in recent years as a way to pass a balanced budget amendment. Those wary of constitutional conventions generally say they worry about the possibility of the gatherings turning into free-for-alls — Democrats seeking to mandate spending for social welfare programs, for example, and Republicans trying to outlaw abortion or prohibit any type gun control.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Successful constitutional conventions during the last century were aided by bipartisan cooperation, said Justin Dyer, director of the Kinder Institute on Constitutional Democracy at the University of Missouri.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We have a very tense partisan time right now,” he said. “The idea of having good will from both parties ... it’s hard to know if we would be able to do that or not.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Lieb reported from Jefferson City, Missouri.
