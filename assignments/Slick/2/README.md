## Install node.js, express, and cookie-parser on your local machine

Both express and cookie-parser can be viewed in the package-lock.json file and within the node_modules directory. Node is installed globally and is assumed.
## Dependencies
Expirimented with a favicon serving package for rendering a favicon. I found this only worked in firefox and not chrome. So I used the html links to the favicon in the headers which works in all my browsers. But I still have this in node_modules and in my server.js code.
```bash
npm install serve-favicon
```
## Set up a server

### Usage
Run:
```python
node server.js
```
And visit:
* [http://localhost:3000/blink182](http://localhost:3000/blink182)
