# Assignment 2 Submission

To complete this assignment, I installed Node.js and then used npm (Node.js package manager) to install express and cookie-parser.

Once I initiallized npm and installed the necessary libraries, I created index.js. The index.js file is the main script for my app and it handles all HTTP requests. I created a GET request handler for each of the 3 "paths" on my server. The server can handle the following 3 paths:

* localhost:4000/white-collar
* localhost:4000/gbbo
* localhost:4000/bull

Each path will show the user a few sentences about each TV show and why it's my favorite. 

I was also able to include a custom favicon.ico for my site.
