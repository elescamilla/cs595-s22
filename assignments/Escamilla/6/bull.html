<h1>Bull</h1>
<p>Bull is a fictional crime-solving show that focuses on the courtroom. 
    Dr. Jason Bull is the owner of TAC, a jury science company that helps clients win in court with the help of psychology and understanding human behavior. 
    My favorite part of the show is that normally justice prevails even if TAC is hired to defend a guilty client.
