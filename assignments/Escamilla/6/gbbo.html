<h1>Great British Bake Off</h1>
<p>Great British Bake Off is the perfect mix of comedy and competition in a light-hearted baking competition.
    Home bakers create professional quality desserts in 3 rounds: Signature, Technical, and Show-Stopper.
    Each week, 1 baker is awarded "Star Baker" and 1 baker is sent home until the group is down to 3 bakers.
    The Star Baker of the final is crowned that season's winner.
