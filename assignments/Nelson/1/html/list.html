		Ford's full-size car from 1959-1974.  Some additional names would be applied in different years, like "Starliner" and "LTD", but mostly they're known as "Galaxie" (note the non-standard spelling).

		In 1966, although the "LTD" was technically a different model, it's really just a Galaxie with "luxury" trim.
