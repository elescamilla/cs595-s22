## Assignment Description - Basics of HTML, JavaScript, and Node

This assignment covers the tutorials "Learn You The HTML For Much Win!", "JavaScripting Adventure!" and "Learn You The Node.js For Much Win!". The original README for this assignment can be found at: https://github.com/jmurp030/cs595-s22/blob/main/assignments/assignment-1.md.

These tutorials, as the names imply, cover the basics of HTML, JavaScript, and node.js. Each challenge in a tutorial asks for the user to create a file, and is then checked against a command "verify" that checks whether the challenge was done correctly or not. There are a total of 44 challenges in all.

* There are Three directories for the three different tutorials that contain the files for each challenge associated with them:
    * [html](html)
    * [javascript](javascript)
    * [node](node)
