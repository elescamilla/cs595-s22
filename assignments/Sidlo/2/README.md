## cs595-s22 Assignment 2

In this assignment, I created 4 webpages that were hosted locally. The first of the four was a homepage linking to three additional pages, each of which representing a favorite of mine.

I used node.js to run the local server on port 4000. In order to do this, I needed to install express. The server file then completes the links set in the index.html file to each of the three page html files. I also added a favicon to the site, so each of the pages show a specific image instead of the default icon.
